âš  ***Important note:*** do not copy the raw script file from your browser or **you will have broken animations**, as the non-breaking spaces will be converted into regular spaces.

Instead, use one of the following methods to retrieve the script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations
```
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations/main/scripts/bash_loading_animations.sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations/main/scripts/bash_loading_animations.demo
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations/main/loading.sh
```
```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations/main/scripts/bash_loading_animations.demo
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Basam1881/bash_loading_animations/main/loading.sh
```
